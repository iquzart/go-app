// Note: Modify this file to include additional endpoints as needed for your load testing scenarios.

// This file defines the endpointList, which contains the API endpoints to be used in the load testing script.

// Each key-value pair in endpointList represents an endpoint, where the key is a descriptive name and the value is the corresponding path.
// For example, 'home' maps to the root path '/', and 'apiVersion' maps to '/api/version'.
export const endpointList = {
  home: "/", // Represents the home/root endpoint
  apiVersion: "/api/version", // Represents the API version endpoint
};
